# Changelog for BaseMUD

## Version 0.0.4 (2019-10-29)

**Project Organization:**

* This project now has a rough roadmap for version 0.1.0 up to 1.0.0 in `BENCHMARKS.md`.
* All TODO messages have been moved to `src/TODO.txt` for staging into
    Github issues.

**Bug Fixes:**

* Reset `'E'` and `'P'` "local limit" flag is unused or was misinterpreted. It's
    no longer saved in JSON files.
* For some reason, skills were always evaluated with a chance of 100%. This has
    been fixed.

**Internal Changes:**

* Object values now use a union with all property types. Nearly all references
    to `obj->value[x]` have been replaced by `obj->v.<type>.<property>`. 
    Example: `obj->value[0]` for weapons is now `obj->v.weapon.weapon_type`.
* Reset values now use a union with all property types. Nearly all references
    to `reset->value[x]` has been replaced by `reset->v.<type>.<property>`. 
    Example: `reset->value[3]` for the `'E'` (equip) command is now `reset->v.equip.slot`.
* Replaced most character and object macros with small functions. Macros have
    been left in place as shorthand functions.
* Moved all top-level booting functions to `boot.c`.
* Replaced "sprintf(), send_to_char()" with "printf_to_char()" wherever possible
* Replaced "sprintf(), log_string()" with "log_f()" wherever possible
* Replaced "sprintf(), bug()" with "bugf()" wherever possible
* Replaced "sprintf(), wiznet()" with "wiznetf()" wherever possible
* Added RETURN_IF_BUG() family of macros to reduce code for common bug early
    exit patterns
* The "TO_XXX" affect flags have been renamed to "AFF_TO_XXX" to avoid conflict
    with act() flags (TO_CHAR, TO_NOTCHAR, etc)
* Clarified wear _flags_ (head, finger, wrist) vs. wear _locations_ (head, lfinger,
    rfinger, lwrist, rwrist). Most code now uses `wear_flag` and `wear_loc` to
    distinguish the two. A few random bugs (likely by me) from this confusion
    have been patched.
* Some error messages in OLC were in Spanish - all messages are now in English.
* All `do_*()` functions are now defined using `DEFINE_DO_FUNC(do_*)`. This way,
    if the arguments to a top-level command are changed, every function doesn't
    need to be modified.
* Moved mob/obj instantiation and clone functions to `chars.c` and `objs.c`. They
    are now named `char_create_mobile()`, `char_clone_mobile()`, `obj_create()`
    and `obj_clone()`.
* Replaced <attr>_app[] lookups with `<attr>_app_get()`, `char_get_curr_<attr>()`
    functions.  Added lookup functions for all stat bonuses.

**New Features:**

* Clarified some error messages caused by `fix_exits()` and `reset_room_reset()`.
* Added warnings for `'E'` resets with unequippable wear locations for the item
  or wear locations that are already taken on the mob. Many of these errors are
  acceptable with the stock world, but many indicate real bugs.

**New Features (if `VANILLA` is disabled):**

* Added OLC editor and vnum to the front of the prompt by default.

## Version 0.0.3 (2019-10-03)

**Project Organization:**

* Reorganized 'Internal Changes' section in README.md to:
    - Deployment
    - Code Reorganization
    - Code Reduction
    - Code Changes
* Reorganized 'Gameplay Changes' section (now 'Game Changes') in README.md to:
    - Bugfixes
    - Patched oversights
    - Quality-of-Life features
    - Gameplay Changes
    - Optional Features
* Many of the "TO-DO's" have been moved to a Trello board for better tracking.

**Bugfixes:**

* When wearing an item, _all_ potential slots are now checked, not just related
  slots (e.g, a ring can now be held as well as worn on a finger).
* In most cases, finding characters and objects by '1.thing', '2.thing', etc.
  will now count correctly when searching multiple locations (e.g, check the room,
  then the rest of the world). This is done by a `find_continue_count()` call
  preceding the next check.
* Checks for immune/resistant/vulnerable flags completely ignored default
  weapon/magic imm/res/vuln flags, despite existing code with implied behavior.
  Resistance no longer overrides default immunity, and vulnerability now
  properly _downgrades_ the default status (imm`->`res, res`->`normal,
  normal`->`vuln).

**Internal Changes:**

* Separated mob- and player-specific flags (`ACT_*`) into separate `MOB_*` and `PLR_*`
  flags, with separate variables. This should prevent a _lot_ of bugs.
* The `wear` command now uses a table for looking up wear slots, as does `char_wear_obj()`.
  This is a big improvement from copy+pasted "You wear ___ on ___" code for each possible slot.
* Weather change calculations have been made easier to understand (but could still be better).
* Replaced `is_safe()` and `is_safe_spell()` with consolidated
    `do_filter_can_attack_real()`. Added shorter functions:
    `do_filter_can_attack()`, `do_filter_can_attack_spell()`,
    `can_attack()`, and `can_attack_spell()`.
* Merged `db2.c` into `db.c` and separated old database functions into `db_old.c`.
* Merged code for displaying exits in `look`, `exits`, and exits in the prompt.
* Introduced `dam_type` classes `DAM_PHYSICAL` and `DAM_MAGICAL` for determining
  immunity.
* Separated descriptor functions in `comm.c` into new file `descs.c`.
* Moved some game loop functions from `comm.c` to `main.c`.
* Several miscellaneous clean-ups for redundant or deprecated code.

# Changelog for BaseMUD

## Version 0.0.2 (2019-08-31)

- Added the entire world as a sample JSON file (`json/everything.json`).
- Reviewed some immortal commands, re-added `addapply` oedit command, changed `vector` and `bitvector` to `bits` for consistency
- Implementors no longer have to suffer wait/daze lag. Fixed "heat metal" to abort if a save is SUCCESSFUL, not the opposite.
- Vanilla open exits no longer show "-" mark when doors are open. Without `#define VANILLA`, dash marks are still present.
- Removed `Dockerfile` until it's updated properly.
- Refactored most of the "wiz" commands.
- Moved "day of the week" and "months of the year" to a table in `tables.c`.
- Weather and sun position now use a table.
- Weather change calculations have been made easier to understand (but could still be better).
- Modified `stand` command to let you stand at/on/in different objects (or no object) when already standing. Likewise, typing `stand` without an argument while standing at/on/in something will step off/out of them.
- Lots of refactoring to 'find_()' methods. Maybe have been renamed for consistency and clarity.
- Added `find_door_same_room()` so you can type things like `open 2.door`.
