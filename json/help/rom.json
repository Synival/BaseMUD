ROM was up for\na little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,\nand various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under\na new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.\n\nAlander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can\nbe found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.\n\nThe following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:\n\nSocials --\n    Kelsey and Liralen\n\nNew, Improved Valhalla --\n    Liralen\n\nPuff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --\n    Seth\n\nMaps and map shop --\n    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)\n\nNirvana zone --\n    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)\n\nMob Factory --\n    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)\n\nGeographically correct Midgaard (tm) --\n    Alander\n\nIdeas and playtesting --\n    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world\n\nThe New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator\nof the ASCII flags used in the zone files\n\nBeta testing --\n    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports\n    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches\n\nBug reports --\n    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,\n    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington\n    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs\n\nROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release\nshares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code\nwas written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions\nand ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on\nMoosehead also remain.\n\nThe new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with\nGabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't\nhave happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and\nwiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.\n\nChanges to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes\nto Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of\nhair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.\n\n(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)\n"

Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n"

Be skeptical\non reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting\nreimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not load things\nat too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a\nproblem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you\nrun a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the\nmain point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce\nrules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light\npunishment.\n\nGods:(57-59)\nGods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.\nHowever, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but\nnot create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,\npurge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected\nto help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.\n\nNot fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.\n"

Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to the implementors.\n \n* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch\n  you doing it, you will lose half your playing time.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.\n \n* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is \n  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n\n* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be\ndone without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,\nand carry a black stick.\n"
