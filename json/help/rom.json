              |a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,\n
              |and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under\n

              |ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release\n
              |shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code\n
              |was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions\n
              |and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on\n
              |Moosehead also remain.\n
              |\n
              |The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with\n
              |Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't\n
              |have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and\n
              |wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.\n
              |\n
              |Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes\n
              |to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of\n

              |    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n

              |    and softening up or altering mobs.\n
              | \n
              |3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n
              |    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n
              |    go there themselves.\n

              | \n
              |6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n

              |    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n
              |    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n
              |    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n
              | \n
              |8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n
              |    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n
              |    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n
              | \n

              | \n
              |10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n
