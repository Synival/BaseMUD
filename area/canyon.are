Vista~
This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:

	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON

Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
overlook.
