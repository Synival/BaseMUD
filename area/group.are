#HELPS

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
ROM has the following races for player characters:
  Human  the standard race
  Dwarf  good warriors and priests, cost 8 creation points
  Elf    good thieves and mages, cost 5 creation points
  Giant  huge, tough warriors, cost 6 creation points

Different races have different starting statistics, and also different
stat maximums for magic items and training.

Creation points increase the amount of experience it takes to gain a level.
For more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf')
~

-1 DWARF DWARVES~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They recieve the berserk skill for free
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~ 

-1 ELF ELVES~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.
~

-1 GIANT GIANTS~
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).
~

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~
 
-1 'GROUP HEADER'~
The following skills and groups are available to your chacter:
(this list may be seen again by typing 'list')
~

-1 'GROUP HELP'~
The following commands are available:
list         display all groups and skills not yet bought
learned      show all groups and skills bought 
premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group
drop <name>  discard a skill or group
info <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group
help <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics
done	     exit the character generation process
~

-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
Command? (list, learned, premise, add, drop, info, help, done)
> ~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The ROM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	  2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
~

-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~

-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is
as follows:

skills:
lore		the lore of magical items

spell groups:
beguiling	spells that control the mind
combat		offensive magics, such as fireball and chill touch
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement	spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion	magics for concealing and deceiving
maladictions	a selection of curses fit for any witch
protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
transporation	spells for getting from here to there
weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail		the proper use of flails

spell groups:
attack		a selection of offensive magics
creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative	spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
benedictions	powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
healing		spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
maladictions	an assortment of curses
protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
transportation	spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing
backstab	the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm		used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack	with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
trip		a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide		the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek		used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

skills:
weaponsmaster	this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
shield block	the art of parrying with a shield
bash		a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
enhanced damage	this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry		the art of parrying with weapons
rescue		allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 ATTACK~
The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and 
thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the 
following spells:

demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
dispel evil	torments evil foes
dispel good	calls down unholy power on good creatures
earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
flamestrike	sends a column of flame from the heavens
heat metal	heats metal equipment to searing tempatures
ray of truth	sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy
~

-1 BEGUILING~
This insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists
of various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.
Only mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of
the following:

calm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room
charm person	turns an enemy into a trusted friend
sleep		puts a foe into enchanted slumber
~

-1 BENEDICTIONS~
Benedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.
They are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and 
warriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the
following:

bless		bestows divine favor upon the target
calm		if successful, stops all fighting in the room
frenzy		puts the recipient into beserker rage
holy word	aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes
remove curse	removes malevolent magic from players and items
~

-1 COMBAT~
These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves
do not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group
contains the following magics:

magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch	weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands	sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp	sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt	sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray	blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him
fireball	a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes
acid blast	sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes
chain lightning	sends lightning bolts arcing through foes 
~

-1 CREATION~
The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent
duration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their 
powers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in
this group, which contains these spells:

continual light	creates an eternal light source
create food	produces a nourishing mushroom
create rose	creates a beautiful red rose
create spring	calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground
create water	fills any available container with water
floating disc	creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure
~

-1 CURATIVE~
The curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can
befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~

-1 DETECTION~
The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use 
detection spells.

detect evil	reveals the aura of evil monsters
detect good	similar to above, only for good monsters
detect hidden	shows the whereabouts of hidden foes
detect invis	allows the caster to see the unseeable
detect magic	reveals magical auras to the caster
detect poison	determines if food is safe to eat
farsight	searches for living beings near the caster
identify	gives information about the nature of an object
know alignment	determines the moral character of a monster or person
locate object	finds a specific item
~

-1 DRACONIAN~
The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~

-1 ENCHANTMENT~
The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~

-1 ENHANCEMENT~
The enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~


-1 HARMFUL~
This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~

-1 HEALING~
The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~

-1 ILLUSION~
The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~

-1 MALADICTIONS~
Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~

-1 PROTECTIVE~
The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
dispel magic	removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
fireproof	shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
protection evil	provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
protection good protects from the attacks of good beings
sanctuary	reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
shield		puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
stoneskin	turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~

-1 TRANSPORTATION~
The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,
which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		transports the target to the caster
teleport	sends the target to a random location
word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~

-1 WEATHER~
These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~

-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~ 

-1 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~


-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~

-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

-1 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

-1 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~

-1 FARSIGHT~
Syntax: cast 'farsight'
	cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

-1 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

-1 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~

-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing 'gc' will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> 'ff orc' will equal "cast 'fireball' orc"

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
