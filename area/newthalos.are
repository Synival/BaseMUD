several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like

Two large stone towers embedded in the wall loom over you. The massive
iron gate, emblazoned with the crest of New Thalos, swings easily on
four ornately crafted hinges. It is obvious the makers of this city
spared no expense to protect their home.  Main street heads towards
the market eastward and the eastern road passes through the Sands of
Sorrow to your west. To the south lies the entrance of the warrior's guild.

you see the open doors of the apothecary shop where one may buy many
magical livations.

Shipwright~
The wood under you feet creaks from years of being soaked in saltwater. An
old man with a curly, grey beard stand behind a small counter waiting to
take your order. Behind him are mounted various model sailboats and large
fish.  There is a large poster stapled to the counter.

Secret Cell~
This room seems more like a lair than a cell. Small bits of hay lie
strewn about the floor covering bones of unkown origin. Spatterd blood
and tufts of grey hair lie matted in one corner. As you turn to leave
you notice a pair of small red eyes peering at you from the darkness.

Saska's Library~
Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.

The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and split into
two bodies of water. The river you are on continues its southern
course and the new river heads off to the east. To the west you notice
a flat area in the sheer rock where it would be possible to shore your
craft. The River of lost souls also continues to the north.

that go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher than other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
