and chairs are broken scattered, bottles and glasses shattered, and
a small performance stage crushed. Musical instruments and personal
belongings lie under the rubble, but the people they once belonged to are
not with them. Looking up you see that the entire second floor and roof
has fallen in, leaving a gaping hole above.

What a shame that this mass destruction also touched this once
beautiful place. The temple's garden path has nothing on this garden.
Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the remnants of one of the watchtowers. Archways
north and west lead back into the city hall.

Unfortunately, it succumbed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tongue.
