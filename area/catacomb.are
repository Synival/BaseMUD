North entrance to the catacombs~
You are almost surprised to see a tunnel leading off to the south
into utter darkness.  The floorboards above you haven't been moved
in a long time, yet there is life down here.  A beam of light from
the opening above you falls upon a message scrawled on the wall here.

The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed

An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.

The burial grounds~
Random tombs to unknown warriors were lain in rows as far as the eye
can see.  To your horror many of the graves are empty and desecrated.
A gap in the rows of tombs leads south and there are more graves to the
east and west.

The burial grounds~
It seems as if many of the warriors could not stop fighting even in
death.  They fight amongst each other and flail at any living being
that would wander near.

Misty cavern~
The temperature is a pleasant and mild here.  This is due to a warm wind
blowing in from the east and a chilly breeze blowing in from the west.
The updrafts create bizarre icy-steamy mists which dance along the
walls.

River of hot mist pour down in a cascade from a hole in the cavern.  It

Several mausoleums used to grace the way here but these have been
defiled. And most have been torn down and burned by looters. Some still
seem to be intact to the south.  To the northwest is a seeming field of
tombs of soldiers, now a battleground for the undead.

Prism cave~
The roof of this cave peaks over a hundred feet high making it one of
the biggest in the catacombs.  Crystals of every color cast prismatic
sprays of light everywhere.  The light from your lamp causes almost a
blinding flare of brilliance as more light is added to the multi-colored
twinkling phenomenon that exists here.  This is also the lair of the
fabled and feared Prism Dragon.

here.  The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed
An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.
