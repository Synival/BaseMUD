The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

can be seen. Looking east, you see a small pass that will allow you to leave

deeper into the foothills or to the west where a small pass will allow you to
climb down.

You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

north, south, and west.

The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.
Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

made their nests here in the rocks and you are heartened by the presence of
life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills
themselves are to the north. The edge of the hills leads to the east along the
shoreline.

The hills overlooking the shoreline~
You stand on a barren section of hills that overlook a rocky shoreline. The
stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

The hills above the shoreline~
You stand on a rocky summit overlooking a rough shoreline below. The sea wind
blows hard across the rocks here and they have been worn smooth with time.
Looking around, you notice that you can safely climb down towards the shore.
The hills themselves stretch towards the north. The rough summit you stand
upon leads west along the shoreline.

The rocky shoreline~
You are on a rocky shore that borders a vast sea. A stiff wind blows here and
whistles among the rocks. You see an altar of some sort built on the shore to
the south. The shore itself leads east and west. Looking up, you see foothills

You stand on a small pedestal like altar that has been built on the shore 
here. Standing here, you can look out across the sea. You can almost imagine
that you see a far away island. Dominating the altar is a small blue portal of
light. It is possible to walk south into the portal. The shore itself extends
to the north, east, and west.
There are small inscriptions on the rock at the base of the portal.

you. Their moss covered branches block out all traces of the sun. The path
here leads east and west.
