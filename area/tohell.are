lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade

to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room

chained. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Their deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...
