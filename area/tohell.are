sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

Ancient Room~
You are standing in a large stone room - feels like a crypt.  Ancient murals
of Hell and punishment cover the walls.  In the middle of the room are stairs
that lead down into the darkness.  From the stairway you can smell brimstone
and sulfur.
To the west, there appears to be a shrine.

Crack in Wall~
This is a rather large crack in the wall. On closer inspection it appears to be
a passageway that was closed off long ago. It was probably reopened by
an earthquake or something.
An ancient passageway continues to the north.

chained. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Their deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...
