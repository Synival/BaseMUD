A nomad camp~
This small group of desert nomads has stopped for the day to rest
and refresh themselves beside this beautiful oasis. Three tents and some
camels make up the party. From within two of the tents you hear muffled
voices, obviously surprised at your visit.

Inside a small tent~
This is a small and simple tent with few possessions in sight. Lying
here and there are young-looking men and women, possibly slaves to the
leader of this band.

The wind-swept ledge~
Being very careful not to lose your balance, you look around and
find that this canyon is about a half a kilometer deep. To the west is
a dark cave leading under the desert sands.

The mysterious lair.~
You have stumbled upon the home of something. From the treasure
haphazardly strewn about and the rotting carcasses, you would guess that
this is a dragon's lair. As to what type, you can't really say. The cave
narrows out into a tunnel to the west.
