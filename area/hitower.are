Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

throne~
The giant emerald is flawless, and must be incredibly valuable.

A dressing room~
You are in a plush dressing room. Fine garments of many styles and some
outlandish colors hang from a rack suspended in mid air at eye level. The
only other interesting feature in the room is a large silver mirror on a
finely crafted gold stand.

The library~
You are in a small cozy looking library. A few well made books sit atop
shelves which span every wall. A large oaken writing table is in the center
of the room with odd papers and parchments on it. The illumination here,
to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

The altar~
You are in a small chapel designed around a beautifully crafted golden
altar. Many icons to lesser deities line the room, but it is obvious by one
glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

The treasury~
You are in a small chamber, the stale air here is testament to the fact
that it has gone undisturbed for many years.

A passage~
You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.

In the light~
You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see
the source of the energy, you can feel its power pushing at you from all
sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
  An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an
exit.

Skylar's Hideout~
You are in a small, very messy room. An unmade bed is against one wall, and
books and papers cover every available flat surface. Empty beer cans lie here
and there, discarded with total abandon. A few over full ashtrays can be seen
on a desk.
