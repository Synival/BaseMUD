Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

From here, it is obvious that somehow, the tower is much larger on the

oblivious to your presence.

tables and a small water fountain here, otherwise the room is quite

a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough to
comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt. In the middle of
