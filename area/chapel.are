Serving Nyarlathotep and Roch'tar, these beings are hunting for victims.
They resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-like or
umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change, twitching
and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great harsh
voices.  A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of the wall near
the base ... oh and he seems quite blind.

He leers insanely at you and says 'heh heh what can I do for you children?
Please don't mind my wife, she is always like that ... hello dear can you
make some tea for our company?  Oh good!  Now sit right down will you?
Would you like hot or cold tea?  Yes the weather is ...'

Entrance Chamber to the Grand Hall of Kings~
Whoever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though you did
enter through a rather small door this place has enough room to hold several
score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven carpet, and the walls are
covered in finely crafted tapestries. You can tell that these things must have
been worth much but they have not lasted well throughout the ages.  Massive
doors lead off to the south and a large stone staircase leads up.

Beneath, there are two criss-crossing scratchmarks in an X formation that
look like someone (or something) raked their claws across the wood.

They're HUGE!  They are at least 12 feet tall and about 10 feet wide.
If not for one thing they would be perfectly preserved.  There appears

tapestry tapestries~
The tapestries were woven into beautiful and exciting scenes of battles
long ago.  One on the left your shows the historic battle between Jubal the
Benevolent and Hroth Kragen's forces that eventually Jubal's army won (of
course).

stone door trapdoor~
It's rather small and looks quite heavy but maybe with some kind of leverage
you could move it.  It has a queerly shaped hole that looks big enough
for an equally queerly shaped pole to fit inside.  If only you had it!

The Grand Hall of Kings~
A long hallway stretches east and west.  On the southern side of the hall
there are many doors, each with the name of a king who has died and is
entombed here.  The hallway is beautiful yet chilling.  Even though the area
has been kept well by acolytes, there remains a stench of the undead.

The Shrine of Crotus~
Mostly rubble, this place used to be the shrine of the famous king Crotus,
who saved the northern regions from being overrun by the goblin hordes of
100 years ago.  If not for him, Midgaard of course would have eventually been
conquered as well.  Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he
turned to the dark ways in his dying years ... and died an evil man.

The Shrine of Mitnar~
Mitnar was a gruesome beast of a man ... he loved battle ... and nothing
else.  Warriors did love Mitnar, and all fighting men honored him.
On the wall is depicted battle after battle after battle.
A small opening has been shaped carefully to the east.

only a rectangular blemish on the floor of the dusty room.
